/**
 * Items pack compiler — produces JSON pack files for the single "items"
 * Foundry compendium from markdown notes in the `assets/content/` tree.
 *
 * The content root (`contentBase`) is walked recursively; any `.md` file whose
 * frontmatter declares a recognized `type:` is compiled into one JSON entry.
 * Files outside the whitelist (blog posts, rules text, templates) are
 * silently skipped.
 *
 * Type-specific `system.*` fields come from the nested `sohl:` block in
 * vault frontmatter, read via `sohlField()`. The body is **not** rendered
 * here: it compiles into the item's doc in the journals pack, and
 * `system.docHtml` becomes a pointer to it (see `item-docs.mjs`). Folder
 * assignment is deferred — every item currently emits `folder: null`.
 *
 * Not a standalone script — exports the `Items` compiler class, imported and
 * driven by `packages/content-build/engine/generate.mjs` (via `npm run build:compiledb`).
 *
 * The walk itself — filtering by type, expanding tables, converting
 * wikilinks, writing the JSON and counting errors — belongs to {@link sohl.utils.packs.BasePackCompiler}; this module
 * states only what makes this pass its own (#1509).
