/**
 * The SoHL-specific half of the toolchain: the knowledge of the Song of Heroic
 * Lands data model that a generic content module must never receive.
 *
 * The item-type registry and its builders, the items and actors compilers, the
 * default-art map, and the affiliation standings live here (#1512). Nothing in
 * `@heroiclands/package-build/engine` exports any of it, so an adventure module
 * that builds journals, macros, and scenes never receives `buildWeaponGear`.
 *
 * A consuming repository hands its own registry to the engine as configuration
 * — `itemBuilders` in `package-build.config.yaml` — which is how the engine
 * composes the one doc-carrying-type set without holding any package's data
 * model.
 *
 * Namespaced rather than flattened, for the reason the engine barrel gives.
