/**
 * `@heroiclands/package-build` — the shared toolchain for building and shipping
 * a HeroicLands **Foundry package**.
 *
 * It is the counterpart to `@heroiclands/content-build`, and the two split by
 * **input**, not by repository:
 *
 * - content-build reads `assets/content/**` and produces compendium packs, site
 *   content and the link manifest. It answers for what a package *says*.
 * - this package reads `lang/`, `styles/`, `src/`, `assets/` and the manifest
 *   template. It answers for what a package *is* — the parts Foundry loads
 *   whether or not the package ships any content at all.
 *
 * A module uses either, or both. An adventure module that ships only notes
 * needs no bundler; a variant module that ships only behavior needs no Markdown
 * pipeline. The coupling between the two packages runs one way — this one asks
 * content-build for the compiled `packs[]` block, never the reverse.
 *
 * **Everything exported here is pure.** Functions take source text and return
 * findings or values; discovery, I/O and reporting stay with the caller. That
 * is what lets one rule set serve a `lint` script, a build step and a unit test
 * without any of them having to agree on how files are found or how findings
 * are printed — and it is what makes the rules testable at all, which the
 * scripts these were extracted from were not.
