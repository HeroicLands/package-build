/**
 * The curated Foundry region-event vocabulary, as plain data.
 *
 * Deliberately **plain ESM** — no TypeScript, no `@src` aliases, no Foundry —
 * for the same reason `../sohl/default-item-art.mjs` is: the map-note pack
 * compiler runs under bare `node`, outside the bundler that resolves `@src` and
 * strips types, and it must reject an authored region event that the runtime
 * would silently drop. One list here is what keeps the build-time lint and the
 * runtime bridge from drifting apart.
 *
 * It sits in this package rather than in the system's `src/` tree because the
 * map-note compiler that reads it is installed as a dependency (#1501), and a
 * relative path out of the package would resolve to garbage from
 * `node_modules`. The runtime reaches it back through the package's
 * `./engine/region-events` entry point (#1510). It is engine-side, not
 * SoHL-side, because any content module that authors a scene region — an
 * adventure module included — needs this vocabulary.
 *
 * The prose explaining *why* each event is curated or excluded lives with the
 * typed re-exports in `src/entity/event/region-triggers.ts`, which is the
 * documented surface.
