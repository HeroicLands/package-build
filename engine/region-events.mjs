/**
 * The curated Foundry region-event vocabulary, as plain data.
 *
 * Deliberately **plain ESM** — no TypeScript, no `@src` aliases, no Foundry —
 * so the Foundry runtime and any build-time consumer read one list, and the
 * events a region trigger forwards cannot drift between them.
 *
 * The runtime reaches it through the package's `./engine/region-events` entry
 * point. It is engine-side, not SoHL-side, because a Scene region exported
 * from any content module — an adventure module included — names its events
 * from this vocabulary.
 *
 * The prose explaining *why* each event is curated or excluded lives with the
 * typed re-exports in `src/entity/event/region-triggers.ts`, which is the
 * documented surface.
