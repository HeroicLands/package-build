/**
 * Macros pack compiler — produces JSON pack files for the "macros" Foundry
 * compendium from markdown notes in the `assets/content/` tree.
 *
 * A `type: macro` note compiles into **two** documents, and this module writes
 * only the first of them:
 *
 * 1. the **Macro**, whose `command` is the script the note carries; and
 * 2. a **JournalEntry** holding the note's documentation, compiled by the
 *    journals pass exactly as an item's prose is (see `item-docs.mjs`) and
 *    addressed by the virtual `docmacro/<shortcode>` qualifier.
 *
 * **The command is read from the raw markdown, never from the journal
 * pipeline's output.** The two copies diverge on purpose: the journal's is
 * table-expanded and wikilink-converted, so it is prose *about* the script,
 * while the executable copy must be exactly what the author typed. The
 * command is the first **language-tagged** JS fence on the page anchored
 * `{#script}`; prose around it and any later fence are ignored here and still
 * render in the journal.
 *
 * **Why an anchored page rather than "the first fence in the note".** The
 * anchor is what makes the script addressable — `[[docmacro-autoattack#script]]`
 * opens the page holding it — and what lets a note document its macro with
 * example snippets that are plainly not the macro.
 *
 * **This does not compile data into code.** A Macro's `command` is authored
 * source shipped as content and executed by Foundry's own macro runner under
 * the user's permission — the mechanism the security model already blesses.
 * Nothing here evaluates, compiles, or revives anything.
 *
 * Not a standalone script — exports the `Macros` compiler class, imported and
 * driven by `packages/content-build/engine/generate.mjs` (via `npm run build:compiledb`).
 *
 * The walk itself — filtering by type, expanding tables, converting
 * wikilinks, writing the JSON and counting errors — belongs to {@link sohl.utils.packs.BasePackCompiler}; this module
 * states only what makes this pass its own (#1509).
