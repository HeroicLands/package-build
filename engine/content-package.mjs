 *
 * Distinct from {@link contentPackage}, and equal to it only by coincidence
 * here: a note says `package: sohl` and its documents are addressed as
 * `Compendium.sohl.<pack>.<Type>.<id>`. In `sohl-thalorna` the two differ
 * (`thalorna` vs `sohl-thalorna`), which is why they are separate values rather
 * than one — treating them as interchangeable is what #1498 was.
 *
 * Configured rather than read from the manifest so the link resolver stays
 * filesystem-free and unit-testable. `assertPackageIdMatchesManifestFile` in
 * `package-manifest.mjs` — called from `generatePacksJson`, before any entry is
 * written — fails the build if this value and the manifest's `id` ever drift.

 * An accessor rather than a hoisted constant, so that importing this module
