/**
 * Where **code** lives in a markdown body, so a rewriter can leave it alone.
 *
 * A code block is verbatim: its contents are shown to the reader exactly as
 * written. Every build-time rewriter that pattern-matches a body therefore has
 * to know where code is — otherwise a source listing that happens to contain
 * the rewriter's syntax is silently corrupted. Wikilink conversion met this as
 * `[[0]]` inside a fence being turned into a link (#1505), and it depended on
 * the surrounding literal's shape (`[[1,2],[3,4]]` survived), so the corruption
 * looked arbitrary.
 *
 * Three forms are recognised, which is every form the content tree uses:
 *
 * - **Fenced blocks** — three or more backticks or tildes, closed by the same
 *   character at least as long, or by the end of the document. A longer fence
 *   contains a shorter one, so a markdown sample can quote a code sample. The
 *   opening line, info string and all, is part of the block.
 * - **Indented blocks** — four columns past the enclosing context, following a
 *   blank line (an indent cannot interrupt a paragraph).
 * - **Inline spans** — a run of backticks closed by a run of equal length,
 *   within one paragraph.
 *
 * The fence syntax is the one `expandContentTables` already reads, and
 * this module owns it now so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * **Known limits.** This is a scanner, not a markdown parser, and it errs
 * towards treating something as code — a false positive leaves an author's text
 * as written, a false negative rewrites it. List nesting is tracked only to the
 * innermost open marker, so an indented block inside a deeply nested list may be
 * read as list prose; a backslash-escaped backtick still counts as a span
 * delimiter; and HTML blocks are not code (they are not verbatim in markdown
 * either). None of these can turn code into a link — the failure this exists to
 * prevent.

 * with another paragraphs away and every span after it paired wrongly: prose was
 * masked as code while real spans were left exposed. And only three-backtick
