/**
 * Wikilink resolution for the knowledgebase build.
 *
 * The same authored links the pack compilers turn into Foundry `@UUID` enrichers
 * (see `./wikilinks.mjs`) become site-local hrefs here:
 *
 *   `[[type/shortcode|Text]]`       → `[Text](/section/slug/)`
 *   `[[Text]]`                      → the same, via a type-scoped alias
 *   `[[type/shortcode#slug|Text]]`   → `[Text](/section/slug/#slug)`
 *   `[[#slug|Text]]`                 → `[Text](#slug)`
 *
 * The KB *section* is not always the type: prose pages (`type: doc`) route by
 * their `category`, so `doc/quickstart` lands on `/user-guide/sohl-quickstart/`.
 * The caller supplies that mapping already resolved, in the index it builds.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in a consumer so every package resolves a link the
 * same way. `sohl-thalorna` carried a forked copy of this as
 * `utils/site-wikilinks.mjs`, already 3 KB adrift from the original, which is
 * exactly the drift one rule with two implementations produces (#20).

 * `scss/components/_unresolved-link.scss` for Foundry and in the Hugo theme for
 * the website, not here.
 *
 * This is deliberately identical to the pack compiler's own `unresolvedLink`,
 * down to the class name and the `title` wording. One authored link renders on
 * two surfaces, and the two builds have drifted before over exactly this kind
 * of detail (#1409) — matching markup is what keeps a reader's cue the same in
 * a journal and on the page. Duplicated rather than imported only because the
 * function is not exported from `@heroiclands/package-build`; hoisting it there
 * is HeroicLands/content-build#13.
 *
 * The knowledgebase renders with `unsafe = true` (`kb/hugo.toml`), so raw HTML
 * in generated markdown reaches the page. That makes escaping obligatory: this
 * is the one path where *authored* text becomes markup rather than content.
 *
 * @param {string} text - The text to show, from the link's label or target.
 * @param {string} target - The address that resolved nowhere, for the tooltip.
 * @returns {string} An inline HTML span, safe to sit in a markdown table cell.

 * markdown link is inert in a Hugo template that prints the value as text, and

 * problem — an ambiguous alias, or a qualified `prefix/key` whose prefix is a
 * real KB section or content directory. Anything else is treated as an external
 * reference — until every package's manifest is present, after which any
 * `type-shortcode` address resolving nowhere fails too. Failures are collected
 * in `ctx.errors`.
 *
 * Whether or not it fails the build, a target that resolves nowhere renders
 * through {@link unresolvedLink} rather than as bare prose (#1665): the author's
 * text is kept, marked so a reader can see a link was intended. Not failing the
 * build is a statement that the link *may* be legitimate prose — it was never a
 * reason to make a dead link indistinguishable from the sentence around it.
 *
 * A target that **resolved** to an entry with no page is not this case and is
 * not marked: a pack-only package (#1516) publishes Foundry addresses and no
 * web pages, so the author wrote a real address and there is simply nothing to
 * link to.

 *   whether every linkable package is accounted for. Together they decide
