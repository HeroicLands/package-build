/**
 * **Map notes** — the markdown → Foundry `Scene` translation (issue #1525).
 *
 * A map note carries an *essence*: a curated, hand-owned subset of what a Scene
 * record holds, exactly as a weapon note carries a weapon's essence rather than
 * an Item's schema. Everything a Scene needs and nobody should have to author —
 * the canvas defaults, the embedded `Level`, every derived region field — is
 * synthesised here.
 *
 * Three note types compile through this module and differ only in derived
 * defaults: `battlemap` (tactical), `localmap` (~1 km) and `regionalmap` (large
 * scale). An unknown type fails the build rather than silently defaulting.
 *
 * **Two unit conventions, deliberately.** Geometry — walls, doors, lights,
 * tiles, sounds, region shapes — is authored in **pixels**, Foundry's native
 * storage, because a traced battlemap's walls do not lie on grid intersections
 * (measured: 97.8% do not). Map pins (`locations:`) are authored in **grid
 * squares**, commonly half-integers, because that is how a human reads a
 * position off the map. The two are told apart by their key: `position:` and
 * segment/shape coordinates are pixels, `at:` is grid squares. Mixing them
 * fails silently and visually in Foundry — a grid-valued wall lands in a tiny
 * clump at the top-left — so both directions are linted here against the map's
 * own `dimensions` and `pxPerGrid`.
 *
 * **What this module refuses.** Foundry accepts several authoring mistakes
 * without complaint, producing a valid document that simply never does
 * anything: a region event outside SoHL's curated set, a region with no shapes,
 * a degenerate two-point polygon, `restrict:` with no level. Each is an error
 * here. So is any `executeScript` behaviour: its `source` is a
 * `JavaScriptField`, and a note carrying one would be data compiled into code —
 * the system's top security constraint. It is not representable in this schema
 * and there is no escape hatch.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no Foundry and no filesystem access, so it is unit-testable
 * and usable from the bare-`node` pack scripts. The compiler that walks the
 * content tree and drives it is `scenes.mjs`.
