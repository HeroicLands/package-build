/**
 * Pack JSON generation — in-repo Markdown → per-entry JSON (build-only).
 *
 * Reads the authoritative content tree at the configured content root and
 * compiles each pack's entries to per-entry JSON under its build directory
 * (`build/packs-json/<pack>/` in this repository). The JSON is
 * a disposable build intermediate consumed by `build:compiledb` (which turns it
 * into the shipped LevelDB packs) — it is never committed.
 *
 * Each `*` compiler walks the whole content tree and selects its own entries by
 * the note's `type` — every note in the tree belongs to this repository's
 * `contentPackage` (#56) — so routing is directory-agnostic: a file lands in a
 * pack because of its `type`, not its location. Which packs exist, in what order, and which folder
 * hierarchy each one loads are all declared in `package-build.config.yaml`;
 * folder files live under the content root and are referenced from entry
 * frontmatter via `sohl.folder: <id>`.
 *
 * This replaces the retired `packs:export` (vault → committed `_source/`); the
 * HeroicLands vault is no longer a build input for SoHL content.
