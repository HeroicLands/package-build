/**
 * Journals pack compiler — produces JSON pack files for the "journals"
 * Foundry compendium from markdown notes in the `assets/content/` tree.
 *
 * The content root (`contentBase`) is walked recursively; any `.md` file
 * whose frontmatter declares either `type: doc` or a
 * **doc-carrying type** ({@link sohl.utils.packs.docEntryTypes} — every item
 * type, plus `macro`) is compiled into one JournalEntry document. Each note's
 * body is split on top-level H1 headings; the optional content before the
 * first H1 becomes a lead page, and each subsequent H1 starts a new page named
 * after its heading text. All page bodies are rendered to HTML.
 *
 * A doc-carrying note compiles into that document's **documentation** — the
 * same prose and pages, filed in the same folder as the document itself, which
 * keeps only a pointer to it. See `item-docs.mjs` for why, and for the ids the
 * two passes agree on. A macro note's `{#script}` page is compiled here like
 * any other: the macro pass reads the same page independently, and withholds
 * nothing from the journal (#1514).
 *
 * Folder placement is identical to the items pack: `sohl.folder` in
 * frontmatter is the target folder's id (from folders.yaml), resolved
 * against a folders.yaml list via the constructor's `folderResolver`. A
 * documentation entry reuses its document's folder id verbatim.
 *
 * Not a standalone script — exports the `Journals` compiler class, imported
 * and driven by `packages/content-build/engine/generate.mjs` (via `npm run build:compiledb`).
 *
 * The walk itself — filtering by type, expanding tables, converting
 * wikilinks, writing the JSON and counting errors — belongs to {@link sohl.utils.packs.BasePackCompiler}; this module
 * states only what makes this pass its own (#1509).

/**
 * Splits a markdown body into pages by top-level H1 headings. Fenced

 * a split. Content before the first H1 (if non-empty) becomes a leading
 * page. Each H1 yields a page whose name is the heading
 * text (with any `{#anchor-id}` suffix stripped out and surfaced as
 * `anchorId`).
 *
 * `leadName` names that leading page. A journal note's is "Introduction",
 * because it introduces the pages that follow. An item doc's is the item — a
 * note with no headings at all is one page holding the whole description, and
 * calling that page "Introduction" would label the description as a preamble to
