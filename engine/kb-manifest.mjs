/**
 * The cross-package link manifest (#1446).
 *
 * Each publishing package emits one file naming every note it publishes, keyed
 * by the canonical `type/shortcode` address and valued with every address that
 * note has: a `path` on the web, a `uuid` in Foundry.
 * {@link loadForeignManifests} resolves each `path` into the `{ url, name }`
 * the knowledgebase already uses as its own index value, so a foreign entry and
 * a local one are interchangeable at the point of use.
 *
 * **Both addresses are optional, independently** (#1516). A note that publishes
 * a page and compiles into no document has no `uuid`; a package that ships
 * compendiums and publishes no site has no `path` on any entry. Neither is an
 * error, and a consumer that cannot use the address it wanted must degrade —
 * inventing the missing one asserts a target that does not exist, which is the
 * silent dead link this whole format exists to prevent.
 *
 * The manifest exists to make one question decidable: when a link addresses
 * `creature-grkrahk` and this build has never heard of it, is that a typo or a
 * note belonging to another package? Before the manifest nothing in the syntax
 * answered that, so the dead-link guard had to be left off for the hyphen form
 * or correct content would fail the build (see `web-wikilinks.mjs`). With every
 * package's manifest vendored, an address that resolves in none of them is a
 * typo, and the guard can be restored.
 *
 * `kethira` is deliberately absent, on a **licensing** ground rather than a
 * technical one: nothing may depend on it, because the module has to stay
 * withdrawable (see that repository's `CLAUDE.md`), and a manifest edge
 * pointing into it is exactly such a dependency. That it ships only packs is
 * not the reason — since #1516 a pack-only package can publish a manifest.
 *
 * **An entry's address is relative to its own package's base** (#1465), never a
 * site-absolute path. Where a package is *mounted* is the consumer's knowledge,
 * held in {@link PACKAGE_BASE} and prefixed at resolve time — so moving a
 * package to another path or origin is one string per consumer rather than a
 * regenerated manifest, and an inbound link survives the move. A path recorded
 * in the manifest would not: it resolves, emits an `href`, and 404s, which is
 * the silent failure the manifest exists to end.

 * renders, and 404s — so the version is what makes a stale vendored file an
 * error rather than a wrong link.
 *

 * (`sohl-affliction-aconite`) so a key *is* the address an author writes; an
 * item's documentation became an entry in its own right
 * (`sohl-docaffliction-aconite`) rather than a second field; and entries gained
 * `anchors`, mapping a note's named sections to the full UUID each compiled to.
 *
 * Bumped to 3 by #1499: keys became **canonical** — fully qualified
 * `package/type/shortcode` rather than `type/shortcode` — and entries gained the
 * Foundry `uuid` / `docUuid` beside the web `path`. A v2 key read as a v3 one
 * addresses a package named after a type, so again the version is what turns a
 * stale vendored file into an error.
