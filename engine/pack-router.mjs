/**
 * Which pack a note's document lands in, when a document type has more than
 * one (#1566).
 *
 * A repository used to be able to ship exactly one pack per document type: the
 * pipeline ran one compile pass per type and routed every note of that type
 * into that pass's pack. Editorial grouping of same-type documents into
 * separate compendiums is ordinary Foundry practice — "Core Spells" and
 * "Expanded Spells" are two Item packs — and `sohl-kethira-basic` shipped
 * three. Collapsing them is a breaking change for every existing world,
 * because a compendium UUID carries its pack name
 * (`Compendium.<pkg>.characteristics.Item.<id>`).
 *
 * **A note declares its pack; the configuration declares the default.** The
 * routing key is one frontmatter field, `pack:`, naming a pack from the
 * configured list — declarative and inspectable, so a maintainer reads where a
 * note lands rather than tracing a predicate. Its `type:` still selects the
 * *compiler*; the declaration selects *which pack of that type* receives the
 * document, and the two are orthogonal.
 *
 * The rules, in full:
 *
 * - A note that declares nothing lands in the **default** pack of its document
 *   type. A type with exactly one pack is that type's default implicitly, which
 *   is what keeps every existing one-pack-per-type configuration — and every
 *   note in it — behaving identically.
 * - A type with several packs designates its default with `default: true`.
 *   Where none does, a declaration is **mandatory** for every note of that type:
 *   an undeclared note routes nowhere and fails the build.
 * - A declared name that no pack answers to — or that names a pack holding
 *   another document type, or a companion pack, which no note may address —
 *   fails the build, naming the note and what it asked for. A silent fall-back
 *   to the default would be #1502 in a new costume.
 * - A note's **derived** documents are routed by the default of *their* type,
 *   not by the note's declaration: an item note's prose compiles into a
 *   JournalEntry, and `pack:` names where the *item* goes.
 * - A note feeding **more than one system** declares `pack:` inside the block
 *   that differs (#58). `pack` needed no new mechanism for that: it is an
 *   ordinary shared property, so `<system>.pack` overrides the top-level one
 *   for that system's document and leaves it standing for every other. A note
 *   wanting one pack for both says it once at the top.
 *
