/**
 * The build **stage** — assembling the tree that becomes a Foundry package, and
 * clearing it away again.
 *
 * A Foundry package is a directory: a manifest, some assets, compiled packs,
 * and (if it ships code) a bundle. Every HeroicLands repository assembles that
 * directory the same way and then either deploys it or zips it, so the copying,
 * the cleaning and the archiving are one implementation with a per-repository
 * *list*, not per-repository code.
 *
 * They were two implementations. This module takes the better half of each:
 *
 * - the **transform hook** from the system repository, which themes bundled SVG
 *   icons for light and dark mode as they are staged;
 * - the **missing-source guard** from `sohl-thalorna`, which fails loudly on a
 *   listed path that does not exist. Without it a mistyped or moved source is a
 *   silent omission — a module that ships with no `lang/` and no warning, which
 *   is precisely the failure this project keeps finding in its own satellites.
 *
 * The rules are pure functions over data; the functions that touch disk are
 * named for the effect they have.
 *
 * @module
