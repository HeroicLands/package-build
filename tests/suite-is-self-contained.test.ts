/**
 * The package's suite must run on its own — `npm test -w
 * @heroiclands/package-build` loads no `tests/setup.ts`, installs no Foundry
 * globals, and offers no `@src` alias (#1511).
 *
 * That is not merely a convenience. The pack pipeline was severed from the
 * system source in #1510, and a test that quietly imported `@src/...` or poked
 * `globalThis.game` would re-couple the package to one particular consumer's
 * repository — passing in situ and failing the moment the package is installed
 * from npm, which is the whole point of extracting it.
 *
 * The system suite carries the same `globalThis.game` guard over `tests/`
 * (`tests/guards/no-foundry-globals.test.ts`); this is its counterpart for the
 * files that moved out from under it, written with no dependency beyond Node so
 * it still runs when the package stands alone.
